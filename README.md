**Andros - Bahamas coastline with palm trees.**

For a full experience in the Bahamas you do not need to limit yourself to exploring the depths. Be sure to go to Blue Holes National Park, where in addition to the blue holes and running streams you can get acquainted with 20 species of wild orchids and 120 species of birds. In the jungle of the park is easy to get lost, so hire a guide and don't forget your comfortable shoes.

**Morne Blanc Trail, Seychelles - Morn Blanc Peak**

The reality is that to the Morn Blanc Peak, which offers a sentimental view, there is a one-and-a-half kilometer winding road, during which you can meet fog and certainly climb through the mountainous terrain through tea plantations. It is said to be worth it. After all, the view from the peak opens up to the whole island and neighboring areas. It is better to go on the road in the morning to avoid fog and sun.
